There are several ways to get help while using Scrite.

## User Guide
You’re already in the right place. The user guide offers detailed explanations
of Scrite’s features. Use the search bar (top-right) to quickly find information
on specific topics.

## Discord Community
Join our growing [Discord community](https://www.scrite.io/forum/) to ask
questions, report bugs, request features, and learn from other users. Before
posting, please search existing threads—your question may already be answered.

Most subscription plans don’t include email support. Discord is the fastest way

## Social Media Support
We don’t actively monitor social platforms for support queries. Comments on
YouTube or posts/DMs on Instagram/X may not be seen.

For the quickest help, please post your questions on Discord. If you prefer
direct email support, consider one of our premium plans. Thank you for
understanding.

## Email Support
Email support is available only to paid subscribers on premium plans. We’re a
small team and prioritize product development over a large support staff. Most
questions are either answered here, or on Discord, or via a quick web
search—which helps us keep pricing low.

> **Note:** We respond to email only from accounts with an active premium plan.
> Please review plan features before subscribing.

## Phone Support
We don’t offer phone support. Even if you have a team member’s number, please
don’t call for support; use Discord instead.

## In-Person Support
We don’t provide in-person support, online or offline.
