# Power Tools
Scrite includes customizable keyboard shortcuts and a powerful Command Center to speedup your
writing. These tools help you work quickly without lifting your hands from the keyboard.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Most menu items, toolbars, and buttons in Scrite have keyboard shortcuts. Hover over any control to
see its shortcut.

You can also open the Shortcuts dialog to view all shortcuts and customize them.

Example: Generate a PDF with `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+P` (macOS). This opens the PDF export
dialog—press `Enter` to create the PDF.

Some actions don’t have built-in shortcuts, but you can assign them. For example, you can set
`Ctrl+Shift+T` for the Statistics Report.

From then on, that shortcut opens the Statistics Report dialog—configure options and press `Enter`
to generate.

It’s that simple. Explore existing shortcuts and customize them as you like.

## Command Center

Scrite has hundreds of actions, and it’s hard to remember every shortcut. The Command Center helps:
press `Ctrl+/` to open it.

Working in a large screenplay? Press `Ctrl+G`, type a scene/act/episode, and press `Enter` to jump.

## Scene Navigation
