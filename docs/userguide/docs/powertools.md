# Power Tools
With customisable keyboard shortcuts and a powerful command center, Scrite offers tools to power
your writing experience unlike any screenwriting app you might have used.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Most menu items, tool buttons and several clickable buttons in Scrite have keyboard shortcuts
associated with them. To discover keyboard shortcuts, you can hover the mouse over any of them.

Alternatively, you can launch the Shortcuts dialog box to take a look at all available keyboard
shortcuts and even configure them.

For instance, the keyboard shortcut for generating PDF is `Ctrl+P` on Windows & Linux, `Cmd+P` on
macOS. Hit that key combination to bring up the PDF export dialog box. Hit the Return key to
generate the PDF.

Some options do not have built in keyboard shortcuts, but you can assign one. For instance, lets
assign `Ctrl+Shift+T` to Statistics Report.

From then on, using that keyboard combination will bring up the statistics report generator dialog
box, where you can configure the report options and hit Return key to generate the report.

It's that simple. Go ahead, explore keyboard shortcuts available and even assign/change shortcuts as
you please.

## Command Center

Given that Scrite offers hundreds of commands & actions, it may be difficult to remeber keyboard
shortcuts for all of them. Starting with version 2, we now offer a command center. Just hit the
`Ctrl+/` keyboard shortcut to bring up a command center panel in the middle of the window.

Type a few words, or even part of a word describing the command you want to trigger and watch as the
command center shortlists possible actions for you.

Once you see an action scroll to it using the arrow keys and hit `Return` or `Enter`. That's it!
