# Importing Files

You can import screenplays from popular 3rd party formats like FDX (Final Draft
13 or prior), Fountain and Plain Text. 

> NOTE: It is not possible to import from Word, PDF or other file formats as
> yet. Work is underway to explore the possibility of importing from PDF by
> leveraging on-device AI. This feature will be introduced in a future update.

## Drag & Drop to Import

The simplest way to import a file is to simply drag and drop a file on the
screenplay editor tab.

While importing from Final Draft is devoid of formatting errors, the same cannot
be said about screenplays imported from Plain Text or Fountain files.

Scrite makes best effort to import well formatted screenplays, but sometimes you
may have to manually reformat in parts.

## Import Option in Home Screen

You can click on the Import option in the Home Screen ..

.. to get a dedicated panel on which you can drag and drop files to import, or
click on the `Browse` button to explicitly select a file to import.

By default Scrite assigns a distinct color to each scene it imports. You can
select them all or in part on the [Scene List
Panel](./screenplay.md#scene-list-panel) and [change their
color](./screenplay.md#color-coding-scenes) at once.

## New from Clipboard

You can copy a screenplay in plain text or Fountain format to the clipboard ...

<img src="../images/imports/006-new-from-clipboard.jpg" width="480"/>

... and make use of the `New from Clipboard` option in the Home Screen ...

<img src="../images/imports/007-new-from-clipboard.jpg" width="640"/>

... to import contents of the clipboard as a formatted screenplay.

This combined with [Paste
After](./screenplay.md#copypasting-scenes-to-3rd-party-apps) context menu option
is especially useful if you are working with AI chatbots to help you craft your
scenes.

> NOTE: Screenplays imported this way may have formatting errors. Please
> manually review and reformat as necessary.
