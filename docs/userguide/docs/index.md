# Welcome to Scrite
Scrite is an open‑source desktop screenwriting app for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Write in multiple
languages, export industry‑standard PDFs, and generate reports—all with tools that suit beginners
and professionals alike.

## Scene‑Centric Approach
Most apps treat a screenplay as pages; Scrite treats it as scenes—because that’s how films are made.
Instead of page counts, Scrite helps you structure and visualize your story with a structure-first
scene‑centric UI.

## Why Scenes First?
Traditional screenwriting apps mirror typewriters: one page ≈ one minute. Page count still matters,
but filmmakers think in scenes. Scrite shifts the focus to building your story scene by scene—making
structure clearer, relationships easier to see, and navigation more natural.

Scrite supports industry formatting while encouraging a scene‑first mindset.

| Page‑Centric Apps	| Scrite’s Scene‑Centric Approach| 
|:------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Think in pages | Think in scenes | 
| Screenplay length = page count | Screenplay length = scene flow | 
| Mimics typewriters | Mimics filmmaking structure | 
| Formatting = aligned with industry standard | Formatting = aligned with industry standard | 
| Navigation = scroll through pages | Navigation = jump between scenes | 

## What Scrite Is Not
To set expectations clearly, here’s what Scrite does not aim to be.

### Page‑Centric ✗
Scrite isn’t a clone of Final Draft, Celtx, or Arc Studio. It doesn’t mimic the typewriter‑inspired,
page‑centric approach. Scrite reimagines writing by using scenes as the fundamental unit of
storytelling.

width="320"/>

> **NOTE**: Scrite does calculate page count, estimates screentime, and displays approxmate page
> boundaries. However, it is not designed to be a page-centric editor.

### Cloud Storage ✗
Scrite saves files locally on your computer. We don’t store your work on our servers, so backups are
your responsibility. We can’t recover lost or deleted files—use a cloud‑synced folder (Dropbox,
Google Drive, etc.) to keep your work safe.

> In the future, we plan to add built-in integrations for popular cloud storage services like Google
> Drive and OneDrive. Until then, you can use the folder-sync features provided by these platforms
> to keep your documents synced across multiple devices.

### Real‑Time Collaboration ✗
Scrite doesn’t support multiple writers editing the same document simultaneously. The app warns when
a file is opened on more than one device, but safeguards aren’t foolproof. Concurrent editing may
cause conflicts or data loss.

> Real-time collaboration is planned for a future update.

### Dark Mode ✗
Dark mode is one of our most‑requested features. We appreciate how helpful it is and plan to add it.
For now, Scrite doesn’t include a dark theme, and we apologise if this is a deal breaker for you.

### AI Copilot ✗
Scrite doesn’t include built‑in AI features today. If you prefer an AI copilot, you can use tools
like ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, or Gemini alongside Scrite.

We’re exploring AI‑enabled workflows that respect your creative voice. When they’re ready, we’ll
announce them on our website and in this guide. 

### Production Planning Tools ✗
Right now, Scrite focuses on writing. We’re assembling a team to build production planning features
thoughtfully.

Planned areas include:

- Shot division
- Storyboarding
- Scheduling
- Call sheets
- Budgeting
- Customizable reports
- Production tracking
- Companion apps for mobile and tablets

We also intend to offer AI assists that support these workflows—without getting in the way of your
creative process.
