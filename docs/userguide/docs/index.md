## Scene‑Centric Approach
Most screenwriting apps treat a screenplay like a series of pages, but Scrite
treats it like a series of scenes—because that’s how movies are made. Instead of
focusing on page counts, Scrite helps you structure and visualize your story
through its structure-first-scene-centric UI.

## Why Scenes First?
Screenwriting apps have traditionally mirrored typewriters, where each page
roughly translates to one minute of screen time, a format deeply rooted in the
industry. While page count remains important, Scrite shifts the focus to scenes
because that’s how filmmakers think.

In Scrite, you don’t write with pages in mind—you build your screenplay scene by
scene. This approach makes it easier to structure your narrative, see
relationships between different scenes, and navigate your story organically.
Scrite incorporates familiar elements from traditional apps, but presents them
in a way that prioritizes scene flow rather than rigid page formatting.

By embracing this scene-first mindset, Scrite offers a unique writing experience
that better aligns with the way stories are conceived, developed, and brought to
life.

Scrite still supports industry standards but helps writers think in scenes first.

| Page‑Centric Apps	| Scrite’s Scene‑Centric Approach| 
|:------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Think in pages | Think in scenes | 
| Screenplay length = page count | Screenplay length = scene flow | 
| Mimics typewriters | Mimics filmmaking structure | 
| Formatting = aligned with industry standard | Formatting = aligned with industry standard | 
| Navigation = scroll through pages | Navigation = jump between scenes | 

## What Scrite Is Not
To set expectations clearly, here’s what Scrite does not aim to be.

### Page‑Centric <span class="red-x">✗</span>
Scrite is not a direct replacement for traditional screenwriting apps like Final
Draft, Celtx, or Arc Studio. It doesn’t mimic the typewriter-based, page-centric
approach these apps follow. Instead, it reimagines screenplay writing by
focusing on scenes as the fundamental unit of storytelling.

> **NOTE**: Scrite does calculate page count, estimates screentime, and displays
> approxmate page boundaries. However, it is not designed to be a page-centric
> editor.

### Cloud Storage <span class="red-x">✗</span>
Scrite saves files locally on your computer. We don’t store your work on our
server, and therefore cannot offer file sync across different devices, nor can
we offer to recover your lost files. 

While Scrite does offer to [auto save](./files.md#auto-save) changes frequently,
helps restore from a [backup](./files.md#loading-a-backup) and also [store
unsaved](./files.md#vault) ones in a private vault, these still rely on your
local computer storage. 

> In the future, we plan to add built-in integrations for popular cloud storage
> services like Google Drive and OneDrive. Until then, you can use the
> folder-sync features provided by these platforms for file sync and backup.

### Real‑Time Collaboration <span class="red-x">✗</span>
Scrite doesn’t support multiple writers editing the same document
simultaneously. The app [warns](./files.md#lock-file) when a file is opened on
more than one device, but safeguards aren’t foolproof. Concurrent editing may
cause conflicts or data loss. We recommend using [Shield](./files.md#shield)
to limit write access to one or more users identified by their email.

> Real-time collaboration is planned for a future update.

### Dark Mode <span class="red-x">✗</span>
Dark mode is one of our most‑requested features. We appreciate how helpful it is
and plan to add it. For now, Scrite doesn’t include a dark theme, and we
apologise if this is a deal breaker for you.

### AI Copilot <span class="red-x">✗</span>
Scrite doesn’t include built‑in AI features today. If you prefer an AI copilot,
you can use tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, or Gemini alongside Scrite.

We’re exploring AI‑enabled workflows that respect your creative voice. When
they’re ready, we’ll announce them on our website and in this guide. 

### Production Planning <span class="red-x">✗</span>
Right now, Scrite focuses on offering a smooth writing experience. In the near
future we plan to build product planning tools like,

- Shot division
- Storyboarding
- Scheduling
- Call sheets
- Budgeting
- Customizable reports
- Production tracking
- Companion apps for mobile and tablets

We also intend to offer AI assists that support these workflows—without getting
in the way of your creative process.
