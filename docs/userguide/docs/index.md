# Welcome to Scrite
Scrite is an open-source desktop screenwriting app. It's available for  Windows, macOS and Linux
laptops and desktops. You can write in multiple languages easily, and create professional industry
standard PDF exports, and reports. Whether you are a beginner, or have just learned screenwriting,
or a professional; Scrite has you covered. 

## Scene Centric Approach
Most screenwriting apps treat a screenplay like a series of pages, but Scrite treats it like a
series of scenes—because that’s how movies are made. Instead of focusing on page counts, Scrite
helps you structure and visualize your story through its scene-centric UI.

## Why is Scrite Scene Centric?
Screenwriting apps have traditionally mirrored typewriters, where each page roughly translates to
one minute of screen time—a format deeply rooted in the industry. While page count remains
important, Scrite shifts the focus to scenes because that’s how filmmakers think.

In Scrite, you don’t write with pages in mind—you build your screenplay scene by scene. This
approach makes it easier to structure your narrative, see relationships between different scenes,
and navigate your story organically. Scrite incorporates familiar elements from traditional apps,
but presents them in a way that prioritizes scene flow rather than rigid page formatting.

By embracing this scene-first mindset, Scrite offers a unique writing experience that better aligns
with the way stories are conceived, developed, and brought to life.

Scrite still supports industry standards but helps writers think in scenes first.

| Page-Centric Apps	| Scrite’s Scene-Centric Approach| 
|:------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Think in pages | Think in scenes | 
| Screenplay length = page count | Screenplay length = scene flow | 
| Mimics typewriters | Mimics filmmaking structure | 
| Formatting = aligned with industry standard | Formatting = aligned with industry standard | 
| Navigation = scroll through pages | Navigation = jump between scenes | 

## What Scrite is not?
Now, that we have made a case for scene-centric UI in Scrite, its important for us to clarify what
Scrite is not, so that you know what to expect and what not to in the app.

### Not Page Centric
Scrite is not a direct replacement for traditional screenwriting apps like Final Draft, Celtx, or
Arc Studio. It doesn’t mimic the typewriter-inspired, page-centric approach these apps follow.
Instead, it reimagines screenplay writing by focusing on scenes as the fundamental unit of
storytelling.

### No Cloud Storage
As an offline app, Scrite gives you full control by saving your screenplays directly to your
computer. We don't store your work on our servers, which means the security and backup of your files
are in your hands. Because of this, we cannot recover lost or deleted files, so we highly recommend
using a cloud-synced folder (like Dropbox or Google Drive) to keep your work safe.

> In the future, we plan to add built-in integrations for popular cloud storage services like Google
> Drive and OneDrive. Until then, you can use the folder-sync features provided by these platforms
> to keep your documents synced across multiple devices.

### No Realtime Collaboration
Scrite currently does not support real-time collaboration, meaning multiple writers cannot work on
the same document at the same time. While the app tries to prevent this by detecting when a file is
opened on multiple devices, these safeguards are not foolproof. If multiple users attempt to edit
the same file simultaneously by overriding these safeguards, it could lead to data loss or file
corruption.

> Real-time collaboration is planned for a future update.

## Supported Platforms
Scrite is currently a desktop-only app, which means you can install and use the app on desktops and
laptops that run Windows, macOS or Linux OS. 

> As of writing Scrite is not available for tablets and mobile phones, though we would like to
support them at some point in the future.

## Subscription Options

30-day free trial, or sign up for a paid plan.

> **NOTE:** Without an active subscription (trial or paid), you cannot use any part of the Scrite
app.

### Creating your Scrite account
When you launch Scrite for the first time, you will be asked to setup your Scrite login by providing
an email id.

creating an account you will not be able to sync your documents and settings across multiple devices

<img src="./images/quickstart/004-activation.png" alt="Activation Code" width="480"/>

Once our web services verify your activation code, it will issue license activation tokens and let
you in.

Each license token has a validity period, after which a new token must be retrieved. This process
happens automatically as long as you are connected to the Internet and use Scrite at least once
every 28 days. If the app cannot connect to the Internet within this time, it will lock itself and
prompt you to reactivate by obtaining a new activation code.
