# File Management

## Auto Save

Scrite auto‑saves documents by default every 60 seconds. Auto‑save kicks in only
after you save your work to a `.scrite` file once. Scrite creates a folder
alongside your `.scrite` file and stores backups periodically.

You can toggle auto‑save, change the interval, and limit the number of backups
in Settings → Application → Options.

## Loading a Backup

The toolbar shows the number of backups available for the current screenplay.
Click it to open a dialog and select a backup to load in a new or the current
window. Backups load anonymously—you must save them explicitly with a new file
name, and they won’t overwrite the source file.

## Shield

By default, Scrite stores screenplays in an interoperable format (see
https://www.scrite.io/interoperable-document-format/). If you want to restrict
opening to devices where Scrite is activated using your email ID, use Shield to
lock screenplays.

Click the shield icon at the bottom‑left of the editor to open the dialog and
toggle protection. You can add collaborator email IDs to allow opening on their
devices as well. Collaborators cannot turn off Shield or add more collaborators.

Note: Shield encrypts contents of screenplay, notebook, and structure tabs.
Photos/attachments in notebook and the title page aren’t encrypted yet. While
our keys aren’t public, we don’t guarantee the mechanism is hack‑proof.
