# Advanced Structuring Tools

Learn how to capture Rashomon, non-linear, save-the-cat and multiple timeline
structures of stories on the structure canvas.

In this article, we assume that you are already familiar with the basics of
using the structure tab. If not please go ahead and read the previous article
before continuing.

## Adding Scenes To Timeline Directly

In the previous article we showed you how to create a scene on the structure
canvas and then drag it to timeline, in order to include that scene in the
screenplay. However this may not be the most productive of ways to create scenes
if you are the kind of writer who only creates scenes with an intention to add
them to the screenplay.

Clicking on the new scene, act and episode buttons in the toolbar creates scene,
act and episode breaks; and inserts them into both structure and timeline as
appropriate. Shown below is a screenshot where a scene has been added to both
structure & timeline by clicking on the "New Scene" button in the toolbar.

We realize that the Structure tab looks a bit different from screenshots of the
tab you have seen until now. This is because by the time we got around to
writing this article, the app was updated and we simply couldn't afford to
recreate all screenshots. As a general rule, please consider material in these
user guides as pointers or hints. It is possible that by the time you read this
guide, the app would have changed further, so it may look different.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts Control+Shift+N on Windows & Linux and
⌘+Shift+N on Mac to create a new scene. As mentioned in a previous guide, you
can pull out the shortcuts dockwidget to review all shortcuts.

Shown below is a bunch of scenes with act and episode breaks thrown in.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot of scenes with act and episode breaks]

Notice how Scrite groups episodes and acts into boxes on the structure canvas.
We will be speaking more about it in a later section.

## Stories Have A Shape

If you have not watched Christopher Nolan explaining the structure of Memento,
We recommend you watch this before proceeding – it's one of the main reasons we
even thought of the structure tab!

The book "Into The Woods: How Stories Work And Why We Tell Them" has a chapter
titled "The Story Shape", where they talk about the fundamental structure of any
story. Writers, many of whom are visual thinkers, like to ascribe a geometric
shape to the flow of their story. Others prefer to capture the structure into
acts, sometimes using colors and almost always using a beat-board placement of
index cards. The structure canvas in Scrite is meant for capturing the shape of
your stories. We are going to be covering formal structures in future sections,
however at this point we want to showcase how geometric shapes can be captured.

### Non Linear Shapes

Let's say your story has two timelines or tracks, and that your screenplay is an
interplay of scenes from these tracks.

We can place scenes from the two timelines or tracks visually apart and even
code them with different colors. By simply sequencing them in a mix, we can see
a shape on the structure canvas that captures the non-linearness of the story.

Given that we can literally "see" the tracks or timelines, it becomes easy to
compose content of our scenes such that they maintain consistency.

timelines]

### "Rashomon" Style Loops

Lets consider another scenario. Suppose that your film has one scene that is
revisited over and over as you explain it from multiple perspectives.

You can simply drag and drop the looped scene at several places on the timeline.
For example, you in the screenshot below you can see how the index card in the
center is dragged and dropped as scenes 1, 6, 11 and 16 on the timeline.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot showing Rashomon-style loop structure]

Ofcourse, we have taken a little bit of time placing the index card groups
around so that we can see the loop clearly. Infact, we can now go ahead and
stack the cards appropriately to visualize the loop even better.

One thing to notice is that the first scene is placed at multiple places in the
screenplay.

An implicit benefit one will get as a Scrite user is this: any content written
in the "Inciting Incident" scene will be replicated in all the four places where
it is placed. Not just the synopsis, which you can already see in the screenshot
above, but entire scene contents as well.

## Selecting Index Cards

Simply click on an index card to select it. Selected index cards are shown with
a shadow and in a more pronounced color and border, than other index cards.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot showing selected index card with shadow and
prominent border]

Index Card on the left is selected. Notice that color of the index card is more
prominent as is the border. Notice also the shadow underneath the index card.

To select multiple index cards, you can click on the selection mode toggle on
the toolbar and draw a selection rectangle.

You can also hold the Control key on Windows & Linux and ⌘ key on Mac and drag
the mouse around the index cards in question to select them.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot showing multiple selected index cards]

## Index Card Context Menu

You can right click on an index card or on a selection to pull out a context
menu.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot of index card context menu]

Using the context menu you can toggle scene heading, change scene color, mark a
scene (explained next), add the index card to the timeline, tag the index card
to belong to a structure group or delete the index card.

### 'Mark Scene As' Option

The Mark Scene As option lets you mark a scene as song, action or montage scene.
When a scene is marked, an icon shows up next to the scene heading on the
screenplay editor, against the index card in structure canvas and on the
timeline panel.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot showing marked scenes with icons]

In a future article we will show how to export these icons into PDF files as
well.

## Arranging Index Cards

The structure canvas is a blank space on which you can place index cards and
annotations (covered later). The purpose behind keeping structure canvas a blank
open space is to let users place the index cards along a shape that makes most
sense for their story.

### Moving Index Cards Using The Keyboard

While you can move index cards precisely using the mouse (or trackpad), you can
also use keyboard shortcuts to move the active item. Just click on an index card
(or annotation) and use

1. Arrow keys to move the index card (or annotation) by 10 pixels (or 1 grid
   point)
2. Control + Arrow keys on Windows & Linux, ⌘ + Arrow keys on Mac to move the
   index card (or annotation) by 50 pixels (or 5 grid points).

By using the arrow keys, you can align index cards with respect to each other.

You can select a group of index cards and use the arrow keys to move the entire
group at once.

### Zooming And Panning

You can use the zoom slider on the status bar of the structure canvas to zoom
in/out.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot of zoom controls and preview panel]

Drag viewport indicator to pan. Click anywhere on the preview to jump.

By default Scrite assumes that you are using it on a computer with trackpad. So
it looks for trackpad gestures to pinch-zoom in and out. If you prefer not using
that gesture or prefer using mouse wheel then you can toggle mouse usage by
clicking on the mouse ([Image placeholder: mouse button icon]) button in the
status bar.

The zoom-fit button ([Image placeholder: zoom-fit icon]) picks a zoom level such
that your entire structure is fit to view.

The zoom-one button ([Image placeholder: zoom-one icon]) picks a zoom level such
that the active index card is shown at 100% scale.

The preview button ([Image placeholder: preview button icon]) toggles the
preview panel on the canvas. You can drag the viewport indicator to pan the
canvas. You can also click on an area in preview to jump to that part of the
canvas while retaining the current zoom level.

### Laying Out Index Cards

The layout options menu on the structure canvas lets you layout index cards
horizontally, vertically and in a horizontal or vertical flow layout.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot of layout options menu]

If there is an active selection on the structure canvas, then these layout
options will apply only to the selected index cards. Otherwise they apply to all
index cards on the canvas.

## Using Act Breaks

So far we have been looking at structure as a shape that can be visually
captured on the canvas. Formally, however, structure in screenplays are spoken
about in terms of acts. The 3-Act structure is one of the most popular
structures in screenplays.

Screenplays are typically broken down into three acts, named ACT 1, ACT 2 and
ACT 3.

• ACT 1 is where we setup the characters and world of the film. While doing so,
we encounter an inciting incident, typically in the life of the hero, which
propels the rest of the story. This act ends with something called "Plot Point
1". ACT 1 typically occupies 25% of the film or 10 sequences.

• ACT 2 is where the protagonist and antagonist confront each other. We progress
towards the mid point of the film, which is typically where the hero is shown to
have won a false victory. After the midpoint, everything seems to go bad for the
hero until "Plot Point 2", by which time it is seemingly clear that the hero's
effort is pointless and is getting her/him nowhere. ACT 2 typically occupies 50%
of the film, or 20 sequences.

• ACT 3 is where we take off from "Plot Point 2" and catapult the protagonists
into a path that takes them to the resolution of the conflict. This act ends
with a climax. ACT 3 typically occupies the remaining 25% of the film, or 10
sequences.

Some writers prefer to breakdown the screenplay into four acts: ACT 1, 2A, 2B
and 3; and some others into five.

Irrespective of your personal preference, you can breakdown screenplay into acts
by inserting act breaks.

Shown below is a skeleton structure with 3 acts and empty scenes.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot showing structure with act breaks and boxes]

Notice how Scrite automatically renders labeled boxes around scenes from each
act. These boxes automatically update their geometry when the index cards
contained in them are moved. Double clicking on a box selects all index cards in
it. The box label tells you how many scenes are in it.

The default behavior of Scrite is to render boxes for each act. But you can
change that, as you will see shortly.

## Using The Beat Board Layout

You can drag acts back and forth on the timeline to change where it occurs in
the screenplay. For example, below we have dragged the act break "ACT 2" from
showing up after 10th scene to showing up after the 5th scene.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot showing act break being dragged on timeline]

By turning on the beat-board-layout, you can ensure that the index cards are
layed out properly, with each act placed on a separate row.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot showing beat-board-layout visualization]

As long as "beat-board-layout" is turned ON, index cards are automatically
placed in that layout as acts are moved around, and also as new index cards are
inserted into the timeline. The structure canvas won't let you move index cards
or act groups, until the "beat-board-layout" is turned OFF.

## Tagging Structural Elements

If you have not already watched this video, we recommend that you watch it now.
In just 5 minutes you will get a good idea about this feature.

## Episode Breaks

When the Scrite project was bootstrapped, we did not forsee that users would
want to use the app to write screenplays of episodes from an entire season.

Early adopters reached out to us asking us for specific features:

1. Keeping track of scenes in structure:
   https://www.scrite.io/index.php/forum/topic/total-scenes-on-structure-tab/
2. Capturing "Bible":
   https://www.scrite.io/index.php/forum/topic/noun-library-reference-wiki-show-bible/

While we are yet to release noun-reference-library and show-bible tabs, we do
have ways to capture multiple episodes from a web-series within a single
document.

Just like we can add ACT breaks, we can also add EPISODE breaks in Scrite. ACT
numbers reset themselves every time an EPISODE break is encountered. Below is a
screenshot where we can see multiple episodes on structure and timeline, each
episode has multiple acts.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot showing multiple episodes and acts structure]

Notice how each episode gets its own box on the canvas, with acts inside them
getting an additional box.

Even on the Screenplay tab, you can pull out the scene list panel on the left
and notice the episode breaks. You can name each of your episodes by typing an
episode name in the text box associated with the episode break on screenplay
editor.

When you export the screenplay to PDF, each episode will start from a new page.

Although this will be covered in a future article, we want to highlight here
that you can configure the PDF exporter to include act names or print each act
from a new page.

## Tracking Story Threads Using Tags

If you have read the article linked above, then you would know that in addition
to using the built-in tags from "Save The Cat Structure", it is possible to
create custom structure categories & tags in Scrite. In this section, we show
you a way of tracking story threads using tags.

Lets say that you are plotting a multi-episode story that spans several
timelines and that you want to capture each timeline as a separate thread. You
can simply capture all timelines under a structure category:

[Image placeholder: Screenshot of structure category configuration]

… and tag your index cards using these timeline tags.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot showing tagged index cards with timeline colors]

This allows you to visually see how various threads are placed and paced in your
screenplay. At some point we will have a feature to filter your screenplay by a
tag name, but until then you can generate a screenplay subset report with just a
subset of tags.

For example, below you can see how only "July 2007" is selected in Screenplay
Subset Report …

[Image placeholder: Screenshot of screenplay subset report configuration]

The generated PDF will only contain scenes that are tagged 'July 2007'. By
reading that PDF you will able to verify consistency of the story in 'July 2007'
"thread" across multiple episodes.

## Structure PDF Export

Once you have plotted the structure of your screenplay, you can share the Scrite
document with your peers and have them review it by opening it using an
installation of Scrite on their own desktops and laptops. But there is one more
way in which you can share the structure canvas with your peers – it is by
exporting it to PDF.

Select Export -> Screenplay Structure to export the contents of your structure
canvas to a PDF.

NOTE: Currently Scrite generates a single page PDF file, which is very useful to
view on phones, tablets, desktops and laptops. If you want to print the
generated PDF, then we recommend that you download Adobe Reader DC and then use
its poster printing facility to break the single page into multiple tiled pages.

## Using Annotations

On the Structure Canvas you can add annotations to aid and expand on the visual
capture of your screenplay structure. Annotations can be used to provide
additional information on the structure canvas, above and beyond what the index
cards provide. For instance, you could insert an image annotation with reference
images suitable for your story. Or a URL that links to a song or reference
video. Or lines to accentuate plot points in your story.

To add an annotation, simply click on the "Add Annotation" button in the toolbar
attached to the structure canvas, pick an annotation and then click on an empty
area in the canvas.

Below is a screenshot where we have added a Website Link Annotation.

[Image placeholder: Screenshot showing website link annotation on structure
canvas]

You can configure annotation properties by using the controls provided in the
Annotation Properties dock widget. You can move annotations just like you can
move index cards.
