# Templates

Scrite’s **Templates** feature offers a set of ready‑made [story
structures](./structure.md) that you can use to jump‑start a new screenplay or
to copy into an existing project. Some template come with their own
[*beatsheet*](./screenplay.md#formal-story-beats) to tag index cards and maps
the story flow on the Structure Canvas.

Available templates are listed in the [Home
Screen](./quickstart.md#home-screen).

These templates can also be accessed from the [Command
Center](./user-interface.md#command-center).

feature‑length scripts that follow a traditional three‑act structure with an
additional act for the climax.

beat on the beatsheet.

Canvas for easy visual tracking.

## Beat Sheet (from No Film School)
A lightweight beatsheet that follows the *No Film School* 12‑beat structure.
It’s useful for writers who prefer a minimalistic approach while still having a
clear roadmap.
