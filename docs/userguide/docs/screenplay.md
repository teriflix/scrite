# Screenplay Tab

The screenplay shown in screenshots are from the 2019 film Knives Out. The original screenplay can
be downloaded from
[here](https://lionsgate.brightspotcdn.com/fb/14/23cd58a147afbb5c758ecb3dff0a/knivesout-final.pdf)
and all rights for the screenplay rests with its owners. We are using the screenplay only for
explaining features in the product.

## Capturing The Logline

A logline is a 2–3 line pitch for your screenplay. It often appears as the short description of your
film on IMDb.

If you want to capture the logline of your screenplay in Scrite, you can toggle the logline editor
in the Screenplay Editor Options Dialog.

<img src="../images/screenplay/002-logline.jpg" width=480"/>

Once enabled, Scrite presents a logline field below the title page on the Screenplay Editor. You can
capture the logline in this field.

<img src="../images/screenplay/003-logline.jpg" width=640"/>

As you can see, Scrite highlights the last few words in the logline in red color. This is because
they spill over the recommend character limit for loglines. While it is recommended that you don't
exceed this limit, Scrite does not prohibit you from capturing longer logline.

## Color Coding Scenes

While plotting, many writers use post‑it notes on a pinboard. Some prefer color coding; others
don’t. If you like color coding scenes, Scrite supports it.

Select one or more scenes on the Scene List Panel, and right-click to view a menu. From here you can
select a color to assign to your selected scenes.

<img src="../images/screenplay/004-scene-colors.jpg" width=640"/>

As you assign colors to different scenes, the Scene List panel uses the same color coding to display
scene headings, as does the scene heading area in the screenplay editor.

Infact, you can also open the scene options menu in the screenplay editor to assign scene color for
a specific scene.

<img src="../images/screenplay/005-scene-colors.jpg" width=480"/>

## Color Intensity

Some writers prefer to see intense colors for their scenes, and some prefer subdued colors. You can
change the color intensity by clicking on Screenplay Editor Options Dialog, and dragging to color
intensity slider as you see fit.

<img src="../images/screenplay/006-color-intensity.jpg" width=480"/>

## Scene List Panel

You can toggle the visibility of the Scene List panel by clicking on the button along the left edge
of the app window, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Alt+0`. 

<img src="../images/screenplay/007-scene-list-panel.jpg" width=720"/>

Using the Scene List Panel you can get a quick overview of all scenes in your screenplay and even
jump to a scene.

By default, clicking on a scene in the Scene List panel causes the scene to get selected. You can
select multiple scenes using `Ctrl+Click`.

<img src="../images/screenplay/008-multi-select.png" width=720"/>

Or hold `Shift` to select a range.

<img src="../images/screenplay/009-multi-select.png" width=720"/>

Whether you select one scene or many, you can right‑click to change colors for all selected scenes.

<img src="../images/screenplay/004-scene-colors.jpg" width=640"/>

### Copy/Pasting Scenes to 3rd Party Apps

After selecting one or more scenes on the scene list panel, you can right click and copy selected
scenes in Fountain format to the clipboard. If the clipboard has plain text or Fountain, "Paste
After" lets you insert it after the current scene.

This way you can copy content out of Scrite to third party apps, and back.

### Scene Heading vs Scene Summary

By default the Scene List Panel shows scene heading for each scene in a list view. You can, however,
configure the scene list panel to show scene synopsis or summary instead.

<img src="../images/screenplay/010-scene-list-panel-summary-text.jpg" width=640"/>

You can change the number of lines from the synopsis to display in Settings.

<img src="../images/screenplay/011-scene-list-panel-summary-text.jpg" width=640"/>

### Empty Scene Icon

The Scene List panel shows an “empty‑scene” icon for scenes with only a scene‑heading but no
content. This icon disappears as soon as some content is typed or pasted into the scene.

<img src="../images/screenplay/012-empty-scene-icon.png" width=360"/>

### Length Estimates

You can toggle display of scene lengths against each scene in the scene list panel, either in terms
of page count or screentime.

<img src="../images/screenplay/013-scene-lengths-in-scene-list-panel.jpg" width=640"/>

Notice how the scene list panel shows aggregate time for act breaks. This helps in getting a quick
impression of pacing in your screenplay.

### Tooltips

You can enable tooltips and get additional information about each scene as you hover over them in
the scene list panel. Additionally, when you select a bunch of scenes a separate tooltip shows up
along the top with aggregate lengths of the selected scenes.

<img src="../images/screenplay/014-scene-list-panel-tooltips.jpg" width=640"/>

### Sequences

As a writer you may want to bundle multiple scenes into a sequence, because they all form a logical
group in your story. Simply select a range of scenes and bundle them together into a sequence.

<img src="../images/screenplay/015-scene-list-panel-sequence.jpg" width=640"/>

Scenes that are part of a sequence have a arrow prior to their scene number in the scene list panel.

You can easily add/remove scenes to a sequence by using the context menu. Bundling scenes together
like this allows you to capture rich detail about the way you look at elements of the story
unfolding across scenes in the screenplay.

### Story Tracks

Scrite lets you tag keywords and formal story beats (from Save The Cat, or your own beat sheet)
against each scene, or on a bunch of them at once. You can enable the display of tracks to get a
quick overview of story elements along side the scene headings in the scene list panel.

<img src="../images/screenplay/016-scene-list-panel-tracks.jpg" width=640"/>

Notice how the tracks on the left also shows a bar for each sequence (#1, #2 etc..) in a separate
track.

More on formal story beats, and scene keywords in a later section.

## Page Number and Screen Time

Although Scrite isn’t page‑centric, page counts still matter:

- Each page ≈ 1 minute of screen time, so page count helps estimate duration.
- Many structures are page‑centric (e.g., Save The Cat breaks into Act II at page 25).

Scrite lets you keep track of current page, total page count, current time and total time on the
status bar. In the editor area, page breaks are shown in a bubble to the left of the editing area.

<img src="../images/screenplay/017-page-time-number.jpg" width=640"/>

> **NOTE**: When exporting to PDF, page count may change depending on MORE and CONT’D usage.

Time values are approximate (1 page ≈ 1 minute). You can adjust 'Time Per Page' in Settings →
Screenplay → Page Setup.

<img src="../images/screenplay/018-time-per-page.jpg" width=640"/>

> **NOTE**: Page counts vary across apps. Final Draft, Scrite, and Fade In Pro may report different
counts for the same screenplay; making them identical is rarely possible. Infact, page count
estimates done by Scrite on Windows, macOS and Linux vary as well.

## Formatting Paragraphs

You can format paragraph types and have that format applied to all paragraphs of those types. Go to
Settings → Screenplay → Formatting Rules to view and edit the currently applied rules. 

<img src="../images/screenplay/019-formatting.png" width=720"/>

Click any paragraph in the preview and alter properties. 

Close the dialog and Scrite applies your formatting rules across all scenes. 

<img src="../images/screenplay/020-formatting.png" width=720"/>

These formats are used in preview, exported PDFs, and reports.

<img src="../images/screenplay/021-formatting.png" width=720"/>

Scrite does not apply special formatting to fragments of text (bold, italic, underline, color)
within paragraphs via Formatting Rules. Use [Markup Tools](#markup-tools) for inline formatting.

Formatting options are saved with the file and reused each time you open it, even if another file
used different options. Scrite maintains two sets of formatting options:

1. Default formatting options used for new files.
2. Document‑specific options used for the current file.

Click “Factory Reset” to discard document‑specific options and use defaults. Click “Make Default” to
set current options as your defaults.

<img src="../images/screenplay/022-formatting.png" width=720"/>

## Markup Tools

Markup Tools let you apply inline formatting to specific snippets of text. The Markup Tools dock is
hidden by default; toggle it from the Screenplay Editor Options menu. You can move the dock to any
part of the screen.

<img src="../images/screenplay/023-markup-tools.jpg" width=640"/>

Select any text snippet and use Markup Tools to apply custom formatting. Hover over buttons to see
shortcuts:

- Bold: Ctrl+B
- Italics: Ctrl+I
- Underline: Ctrl+U
- Strikeout: Ctrl+R
- ALL CAPS: Shift+F3
- small caps: Ctrl+Shift+F3

<img src="../images/screenplay/024-markup-tools.jpg" width=640"/>

## Custom Scene Numbers

By default, Scrite generates scene numbers automatically and regenerates them if you change order or
insert scenes. 

<img src="../images/screenplay/025-custom-scene-numbers.png" width=720"/>

You can apply custom numbers (e.g., 1, 1A, 1B) by editing the scene number field. Automatic
numbering resumes for scenes without custom numbers. Custom numbers appear in preview, exported
PDFs, and reports.

<img src="../images/screenplay/026-custom-scene-numbers.png" width=720"/>

## Scene Comments, Featured Image and Index Card Fields

Scrite lets you capture additional information per scene. While the Notebook tab is best for
capturing this information, but the Screenplay editor offers access to Comments, Featured Image, and
Index Card Fields.

### Comments

Enable “Scene Comments” in Screenplay Editor Options to show a pullout for each scene. 

<img src="../images/screenplay/027-scene-comments-panel.jpg" width=720"/>

Clicking it opens a comment box per scene. For long scenes, the comment box scrolls with the scene
and shows a title bar for clarity.

<img src="../images/screenplay/028-scene-comments-panel.jpg" width=720"/>

### Featured Image

The comment box has multiple tabs. Click the Featured Image tab to assign a photo per scene. Drag and
drop or click “Select Photo”. Typically this is a storyboard sketch or location photo, but you can
choose any image.

<img src="../images/screenplay/029-featured-image.jpg" width=720"/>

### Index Card Fields

Use the last tab to capture structured metadata per scene. By default, Index Card Fields includes:

- Conflict
- Emotional Change
- Page Target

You can edit these fields by clicking the Edit icon; configure up to five fields. These fields can
also be edited in the Structure tab.

<img src="../images/screenplay/030-index-card-fields.jpg" width=720"/>

## Tagging Character Presence in Scenes

Scrite automatically tags character presence in a scene if they have dialogue. This tagging is
useful for extracting reports (e.g., dialogues of a specific character or character presence across
scenes).

### Adding Mute Characters

Add mute characters manually via the + icon, or automatically using “Scan for Mute Characters” in
Screenplay Editor Options. Scrite looks for references to character names present in the scene
without dialogue. Mute characters are recognized if they appear in at least one other scene.
Scanning currently works only for English names.

< screenshot >

### Invisible Characters

Characters with dialogue may be invisible (e.g., voice heard but character not seen). Invisible
character names are shown in italics if “Capture Invisible Character” is checked in Settings →
Screenplay → Options.

< screenshot >

### Rename Character

With “Show Scene Characters and Tags” enabled, click a character under the scene heading and select
“Rename/Merge Character” to rename. Scrite updates character names across headings, paragraphs,
synopsis, and notes. Works best with English names in Latin script.

< screenshot >

### Merge Characters

If you used two names for the same character, use “Rename/Merge Character” to merge. Scrite updates
occurrences across the screenplay and moves notes, attachments, and photos accordingly. Works best
with English names in Latin script.

< screenshot >

## Writing with Scene‑Centric Precision in Scrite

Scrite’s scene‑centric architecture treats each scene as a discrete block of text, loading only
what’s visible to keep memory usage low and performance smooth. Most professional screenplays use
short scenes, with occasional longer ones. Scrite is optimized for this style. If most scenes exceed
two pages, performance may degrade.

Best practices:

- Keep most scenes under a page.
- Use a few two‑page scenes sparingly.
- For long sequences in one location, break into smaller scenes: start with a proper heading, divide
  into logical beats, and omit headings for subsequent beats if desired.

### Scenes Without Heading

You can turn off scene headings for specific scenes. Pull out the scene menu and uncheck “Scene
Heading”. The editor shows “NO SCENE HEADING”. Such scenes are shown as is in preview and exported
as such in PDF and reports.

< screenshot >

### Inserting Scenes

Make the target scene active, then click “Add Scene” on the toolbar or use `Ctrl+Shift+N`. Scrite
inserts a new scene with a heading based on the previous scene; edit heading and contents as needed.

< screenshot >

### Removing Scenes

Pull out the scene menu and select “Remove”. Removed scenes aren’t deleted; add them back from the
Structure tab.

< screenshot >

### Splitting Scenes

Place the cursor before the first character of the paragraph where you want to split, then
right‑click and select “Split Scene” or use `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+Shift+Return`
(macOS). Dialogue character lists are split accurately; mute characters remain in the original
scene.

< screenshot >

### Merging Scenes

Place the cursor at the first line of the scene to merge into the previous one, then right‑click
“Join Previous Scene” or use `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+Shift+Backspace` (macOS).
Scrite inserts a separator paragraph; you can delete it.

< screenshot >

### Reordering Scenes

Drag scenes in the Scene List panel to reorder. Heading‑less scenes inherit context from the
previous scene in their new location.

< screenshot >

## Spell Check

Scrite integrates with your operating system’s spell check, sharing dictionaries with other apps. As
of writing, Scrite supports spell check for English; more languages are planned.

Enable/disable in Settings. Misspelled words are highlighted in red; right‑click for corrections.
Choose “Add to dictionary” (system‑wide) or “Ignore” (current document only). Scrite recognizes
character names as correct by default. Grammar check is not yet available.

< screenshot >

## Auto Save

Scrite auto‑saves documents by default every 60 seconds. Auto‑save kicks in only after you save your
work to a `.scrite` file once. Scrite creates a folder alongside your `.scrite` file and stores
backups periodically.

You can toggle auto‑save, change the interval, and limit the number of backups in Settings →
Application → Options.

< screenshot >

## Loading A Backup

The toolbar shows the number of backups available for the current screenplay. Click it to open a
dialog and select a backup to load in a new or the current window. Backups load anonymously—you must
save them explicitly with a new file name, and they won’t overwrite the source file.

< screenshot >

## Shield

By default, Scrite stores screenplays in an interoperable format (see
https://www.scrite.io/interoperable-document-format/). If you want to restrict opening to devices
where Scrite is activated using your email ID, use Shield to lock screenplays.

Click the shield icon at the bottom‑left of the editor to open the dialog and toggle protection. You
can add collaborator email IDs to allow opening on their devices as well. Collaborators cannot turn
off Shield or add more collaborators.

Note: Shield encrypts contents of screenplay, notebook, and structure tabs. Photos/attachments in
notebook and the title page aren’t encrypted yet. While our keys aren’t public, we don’t guarantee
the mechanism is hack‑proof.
