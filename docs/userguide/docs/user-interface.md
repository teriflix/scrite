# User Interface
Scrite includes customizable keyboard shortcuts and a powerful Command Center to speedup your
writing. These tools help you work quickly without lifting your hands from the keyboard.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Most menu items, toolbars, and buttons in Scrite have keyboard shortcuts. Hover over any control to
see its shortcut.

You can also open the Shortcuts dialog by using `Ctrl+E` on Windows & Linux, `Cmd+E` on macOS to
view all shortcuts and customize them.

Example: You can launch the Settings dialog by using `Ctrl+,` on Windows and Linux, and `Cmd+,` on
macOS.

Some actions don’t have built-in shortcuts, but you can assign them. For example, you can set
`Ctrl+Alt+T` for the Statistics Report. If a shortcut you assign clashes with another, then Scrite
show you a message and lets you configure another shortcut.

From then on, that shortcut opens the Statistics Report dialog—configure options and press `Enter`
to generate.

By clicking on the Revert icon next to the shortcut, you can revert to default.

It’s that simple. Explore existing shortcuts and customize them as you like.

## Command Center

Scrite has hundreds of actions, and it’s hard to remember every shortcut. The Command Center helps:
press `Ctrl+/` or `Cmd+/` to open it.

Type a few letters of the command you need; the Command Center filters and shows matching actions.

Use the arrow keys to select an action and press `Enter`. That’s it.

Optionally, you can click on the Assign link next to command for which there is no shortcut, and
assign a custom shortcut.

The command center also lists templates, scripts from Scriptalay and your recently open files as
well. You can look for them by typing file name, or author, title, subtitle, or any word in the
logline.

> **NOTE**: Command center only lists actions that are available in the current context. So its
> possible that you won't find one or more commands in here, even though they are listed in the
> shortcuts dialog box.

## Jump to Scene
Working in a large screenplay? Press `Ctrl+G`, type a scene/act/episode, and press `Enter` to jump.

## Scene Navigation
With keyboard focus on the scene content area in any scene within the screenplay editor, use
`Alt+Up`/`Alt+Down` to jump to the previous/next scene. Use `Ctrl+Alt+Up`/`Ctrl+Alt+Down` to jump to
the first/last scene.

Additionally, while typing scene content, you can also:

|Action|Shortcut|
|:-----|:-------|
|Toggle Synopsis|`Ctrl+Alt+S`| 
|Toggle Character & Scene Tags|`Ctrl+Alt+C`| 
|Edit Scene Heading|`Ctrl+0`| 
|Edit Scene Number|`Ctrl+Alt+0`|

You don’t have to memorize these, open the Shortcuts Dialog (`Ctrl+E`/`Cmd+E`) to discover.
