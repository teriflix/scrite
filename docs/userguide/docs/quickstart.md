## Home Screen
When you start Scrite, you’ll see the Home Screen.

<img src="../images/quickstart/007-home-screen.png" alt="Home Screen" width="720"/>

From here you can:

- Start a new document (blank or from a template)
- Open a screenplay from Scriptalay (our online mini‑library)
- Open a document from your local disk
- Import from Final Draft (FDX) or Fountain
- Recover unsaved screenplays from the vault
- Quickly access recent files

This guide will show you how to write your first screenplay, capture notes, plot your story, format
scenes, and export your work.

## Importing Screenplays
Many writers start by importing existing screenplays from Final Draft or Fountain. To do this, close
the Home Screen and drag‑and‑drop your FDX or Fountain file onto the Scrite window.

<img src="../images/quickstart/008-importing-screenplays.png" alt="Importing Screenplays"
width="720"/>

Scrite supports Final Draft (FDX) files created with versions 5 through 13. Paragraphs formatted as
scene heading, action, character, parenthetical, shot, and transition are imported and tagged
accordingly. Plain text and Fountain files are also supported, with minor import differences
possible.

After import, open the Scene List panel (left‑side icon) or press `Alt+0` to view all scenes.

Click any scene in the list to jump to it in the editor.

Scrite calculates page count and estimates screen time after import. The Scene List shows each
scene’s estimated duration; hover a scene to view more metadata. By default, one page ≈ one
minute—this can be configured.

> **NOTE**: Scrite estimates page count and screentime in a background thread, which means that it
> may take some time before you see final estimates on the UI.

## Creating a New Screenplay
To start from scratch, open the Home Screen and select “Blank Document”.

<img src="../images/quickstart/010-blank-document.png" alt="Blank Document" width="720"/>

Your first document starts with a blank scene, using a default heading like `EXT. SOMEWHERE – DAY`.

<img src="../images/quickstart/010-first-scene.png" alt="First Scene" width="720"/>

Scrite’s UI is scene‑centric: you won’t see pages; you’ll work with a text block for each scene.

To create a new scene, click `New Scene` on the toolbar or use `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows/Linux) or
`⌘+Shift+N` (macOS).

<img src="../images/quickstart/011-second-scene.png" alt="Adding a Scene" width="540"/>

This creates a new empty scene after the selected scene (or at the end if none is selected).

<img src="../images/quickstart/012-second-scene.png" alt="Second Scene" width="720"/>

You can also append a new scene, act, or episode break using the buttons at the end.

Scrite adds the scene with a default heading and places the cursor in the content area.

## Saving and Opening Files
New files start unnamed and unsaved. You can work freely until you choose to save.

Autosave is available once enabled and after you’ve saved the file at least once to a writable
location.

To save, click the Save icon, choose a folder, and enter a name. Scrite files use the `.scrite`
extension.

You can open files by:

- Double‑clicking the `.scrite` file in File Explorer (Windows), Finder (macOS), or
  Nautilus/Konqueror (Linux)
- Using the Home Screen’s Open option or `Ctrl+O` (Windows/Linux), `⌘+O` (macOS)
- Drag‑and‑dropping the document onto the app window

## Editing the Scene Heading
Click the scene heading or press `Ctrl+0` (`⌘+0`) to move the cursor to the heading and edit it.

Press `Enter` to switch the cursor to the scene content area.

Unlike many apps that let you mark any paragraph as a scene heading, Scrite requires creating a
scene and assigning its heading. In a later article, we’ll show when (and why) you can create scenes
without a heading.

The scene heading area is color‑tinted and shows the character list. You can also show the scene
synopsis.

< Screenshot >

Enable “Scene Synopsis” to reveal a field in the heading where you can type the scene’s synopsis.

Use the Synopsis field to jot a brief description of the scene. By default, synopsis isn’t exported
to PDF—you can enable it if desired.

## Typing Scene Content

Format action, character, dialogue, parenthetical, shot, and transition paragraphs using the toolbar
buttons.

< Screenshot >

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to switch paragraph types:

| Paragraph Type | Windows, Linux | macOS | 
|:---------------|:---------------|:------|
| Action | Ctrl+1 | ⌘+1 | 
| Character | Ctrl+2 | ⌘+2 | 
| Dialogue | Ctrl+3 | ⌘+3 | 
| Parenthetical | Ctrl+4 | ⌘+4 | 
| Shot | Ctrl+5 | ⌘+5 | 
| Transition | Ctrl+6 | ⌘+6 | 

In many cases, pressing `Tab` advances the current paragraph to the next appropriate type.

Below is an example scene with paragraphs properly formatted.

## Adding More Scenes

Keep creating scenes and adding content. To add a new scene, click the button at the end of the page
or use the toolbar.

> **A note on scene lengths**
>
> Scrite is optimized for screenplays with mostly short scenes. The app performs best when scenes
> are under a page, with occasional scenes up to two pages. Longer scenes are supported, but if most
> scenes exceed two pages, performance may suffer. Keeping scenes concise helps pacing and
> readability.

## Scene List Panel
Toggle the Scene List panel using the icon along the left edge of the window.

<screenshot>

Click a scene heading to switch the editor to that scene. You can reorder scenes by dragging them to
a new position.

## Distraction‑Free Writing
Use “Screenplay Editor Options” to hide the character list and synopsis panels.

<screenshot>

Collapse the Scene List panel to maximize your writing area.

## Editing the Title Page
Click “Edit Title Page” at the top of your screenplay, or by using the keyboard shortcut
`Ctrl+Shift+T`.

<Screenshot>

This opens the Title Page editor where you can assign a cover image and fill in title‑page fields.

<screenshot>

Click the close icon (top‑right) to apply changes. The title page appears before the first scene.

## Exporting to PDF
Select `Export → Adobe PDF`, or press `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+P` (macOS) to preview your PDF.

The Export dialog offers options to customize your PDF—toggle title page, include synopsis, and
more.

<screenshot>

Review the options and customize the output to your preference.

Click “Generate PDF” to create a preview.

When you’re satisfied, click “Save PDF” to export to a location of your choice.
