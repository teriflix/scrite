# Quick Start
If you are a self-learner who just needs a jump start, then this chapter is for
you. We won't bore you with the details, but rather will quickly help you put
together your first screenplay by providing just enough information. You can
always come back to this guide and explore other chapters to discover finer
details.

Instead of text, if you would much rather watch a video then this one is for
you:

If you prefer text descriptions, then here we go!

> **NOTE**: Screenshots may not match the current UI. Scrite evolves
> continuously, so visuals and layout can change.

## Home Screen
When you start Scrite, you’ll see the Home Screen.

<img src="../images/quickstart/007-home-screen.png" width="100%"/>

From here you can:

- Start a new document (blank or from a template)
- Open a screenplay from Scriptalay (our online mini‑library)
- Open a document from your local disk
- Import from Final Draft (FDX) or Fountain
- Recover unsaved screenplays from the vault
- Quickly access recent files

This guide will show you how to write your first screenplay, capture notes, plot
your story, format scenes, and export your work.

## Importing Screenplays
Many writers start by importing existing screenplays from Final Draft or
Fountain. To do this, close the Home Screen and drag‑and‑drop your FDX or
Fountain file onto the Scrite window.

<img src="../images/quickstart/008-importing-screenplays.png" width="100%"/>

Scrite allows importing from:

- Final Draft (FDX) files, created with versions 5 through 13. Paragraphs
formatted as scene heading, action, character, parenthetical, shot, and
transition are imported and tagged accordingly. 
- Plain text and Fountain files. There may be minor import errors, which you can
  manually fix.

## Scene List Panel
After import, open the Scene List panel (left‑side icon) or press `Alt+0` to
view all scenes.

<img src="../images/quickstart/009-scene-list-panel.png" width="100%"/>

Click any scene in the list to jump to it in the editor.

Scrite calculates page count and estimates screen time after import. The Scene
List shows each scene’s estimated duration; hover a scene to view more metadata.
By default, one page ≈ one minute—this can be configured.

<img src="../images/quickstart/009-page-and-time-estimate.png" width="75%"/>

> **NOTE**: Scrite estimates page count and screentime in a background thread,
> which means that it may take some time before you see final estimates on the
> UI.

You can reorder scenes by dragging them to a new position.

## Creating a New Screenplay
To start from scratch, open the Home Screen and select "Blank Document".

<img src="../images/quickstart/010-blank-document.png" width="100%"/>

Your first document starts with a blank scene, using a default heading like
`EXT. SOMEWHERE – DAY`.

<img src="../images/quickstart/010-first-scene.png" width="100%"/>

Scrite’s UI is scene‑centric: you won’t see pages; you’ll work with a text block
for each scene.

To create a new scene, click `New Scene` on the toolbar or use `Ctrl+Shift+N`
(Windows/Linux) or `⌘+Shift+N` (macOS).

<img src="../images/quickstart/011-second-scene.png" width="75%"/>

This creates a new empty scene after the selected scene (or at the end if none
is selected).

<img src="../images/quickstart/012-second-scene.png" width="100%"/>

You can also append a new scene, act, or episode break using the buttons at the
end. More on this in a [later section](#adding-more-scenes).

<img src="../images/quickstart/013-adding-elements.png" width="40%"/>

Scrite adds the scene with a default heading and places the cursor in the
content area.

## Saving Files
New files are created without a name and remain unsaved, allowing you to work
freely until you choose to save them. Autosave becomes available after you save
the file at least once to a writable location. Until then, your changes are
temporarily stored in a vault folder on your hard drive, which you can use to
recover your work if you forget to save before exiting Scrite.

To save, click the Save icon, choose a folder, and enter a name. Scrite files
use the `.scrite` extension.

## Opening Files
You can open files by:

- Double‑clicking the `.scrite` file in File Explorer (Windows), Finder (macOS),
  or Nautilus/Konqueror (Linux)
- Using the Home Screen’s Open option or `Ctrl+O` (Windows/Linux), `⌘+O`
  (macOS). Scrite lists up to ten recent files in this screen.
- Drag‑and‑dropping the document onto the app window

## Editing the Scene Heading
Click the scene heading or press `Ctrl+0` (`⌘+0`) to move the cursor to the
heading and edit it.

<img src="../images/quickstart/014-editing-scene-heading.png" width="75%"/>

Press `Enter` to switch the cursor to the scene content area.

Unlike many apps that let you mark any paragraph as a scene heading, Scrite
requires creating a scene and assigning its heading. In a later article, we’ll
show when (and why) you can create scenes without a heading.

The scene heading area is color‑tinted and shows the character list. You can
also show the scene synopsis.

<img src="../images/quickstart/015-enabling-scene-heading-fields.png"
width="75%"/>

By enabling the highlighted options in this dialog box, you will see a space for
synopsis, characters and tags in each scene heading. This is especially useful
in large screenplays where you may want to capture synopsis, and additional meta
data against each scene.

<img src="../images/quickstart/016-synopsis-characters-tags.png" width="100%"/>

By default, synopsis isn’t exported to PDF—you can enable it if desired.

While typing scene content, if you want to quickly switch to the synopsis field,
make changes, and come back you can

- Hit `Ctrl+8` to switch focus to the active scene's synopsis field
- Once you finish editing changes in the synopsis field, hit `Esc` to move the
  focus back to the scene content area

## Typing Scene Content
Format action, character, dialogue, parenthetical, shot, and transition
paragraphs using the toolbar buttons.

<img src="../images/quickstart/017-format-toolbar.png" width="40%"/>

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to switch paragraph types:

| Paragraph Type | Windows, Linux | macOS | 
|:---------------|:---------------|:------|
| Action | Ctrl+1 | ⌘+1 | 
| Character | Ctrl+2 | ⌘+2 | 
| Dialogue | Ctrl+3 | ⌘+3 | 
| Parenthetical | Ctrl+4 | ⌘+4 | 
| Shot | Ctrl+5 | ⌘+5 | 
| Transition | Ctrl+6 | ⌘+6 | 

In many cases, pressing `Tab` advances the current paragraph to the next
appropriate type.

Below is an example scene with paragraphs properly formatted.

<img src="../images/quickstart/018-formatted-scene.png" width="100%"/>

## Adding More Scenes
Keep creating scenes and adding content. To add a new scene, click the button at
the end of the page or use the toolbar.

<img src="../images/quickstart/019-episode-scene-act-toolbar.png" width="40%"/>

Alternatively, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts to insert a scene,
act or episode break after the current scene.

| Type | Windows, Linux | macOS | 
|:---------------|:---------------|:------|
| Scene | Ctrl+Shift+N | ⌘+Shift+N | 
| Act | Ctrl+Shift+B | ⌘+Shift+B | 
| Episode | Ctrl+Shift+P | ⌘+Shift+P | 

> **NOTE**: In the chapter on [User Interface](user-interface.md) you can find
tips to discover and configure keyboard shortcuts to your liking.

### A note on scene lengths
Scrite is optimized for screenplays with mostly short scenes. The app performs
best when scenes are under a page, with occasional scenes up to two pages.
Longer scenes are supported, but if most scenes exceed two pages, performance
may suffer. Keeping scenes concise helps pacing and readability.

<img src="../images/quickstart/020-long-scene-warning.png" width="75%"/>

## Distraction‑Free Writing
Use "Screenplay Editor Options" to hide the character list and synopsis panels,
optionally reducing color intensity if you prefer. 

<img src="../images/quickstart/021-distraction-free-writing.png" width="75%"/>

Hide the toolbar using keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+.`, and collapse the "Scene List
Panel" with keyboard shortcut `Alt+0` to maximize your writing area.

<img src="../images/quickstart/022-distraction-free-writing.png" width="100%"/>

## Editing the Title Page
Click "Edit Title Page" at the top of your screenplay, or by using the keyboard
shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+T`. This opens the Title Page editor where you can assign a
cover image and fill in title‑page fields.

<img src="../images/quickstart/023-title-page-fields.png" width="100%"/>

Click the close icon (top‑right) to apply changes. The title page appears before
the first scene.

<img src="../images/quickstart/024-title-page.png" width="100%"/>

## Exporting to PDF
Select `Export → Adobe PDF`, or press `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+P` (macOS)
to preview your PDF.

The Export dialog offers options to customize your PDF—toggle title page,
include synopsis, and more.

<img src="../images/quickstart/025-pdf-export-dialog.png" width="75%"/>

Review the options and customize the output to your preference.

Click "Generate PDF" to create a preview.

<img src="../images/quickstart/026-pdf-with-watermark.png" width="100%"/>

When you’re satisfied, click "Save PDF" to export to a location of your choice.

**NOTE**: During the free trial, the default watermark can’t be changed or
removed. Purchase a plan that supports watermark customization to modify or
remove it.
