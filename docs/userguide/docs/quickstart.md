## Home Screen
The first thing you will be greeted with when you start Scrite is the Home Screen.

<img src="../images/quickstart/007-home-screen.png" alt="Home Screen" width="720"/>

From this screen you can

- Start a new document, either from scratch or from one of the templates provided.
- Open a document from Scriptalay, our online mini-library of screenplays
- Open a document from your local disk
- Import from Final Draft or Fountain formats
- Or recover unsaved screenplays from the vault.
- Once you have worked with one or more documents, you will also be able to pick from a list of
  recent files from here.

In subsequent chapters of this user guide, we will show you how to write your first screenplay, and
use professional writing tools to capture notes, plot your store, format scenes and export your
work.

## Importing Screenplays
Many of our users are professional writers. The first thing they do when they install Scrite is to
import their existing screenplays from Final Draft or Fountain formats. If you would like to do the
same, then close the Home Screen and simply drag and drop your FDX or Fountain files on to the
Scrite window.

width="720"/>

Scrite supports importing from Final Draft (FDX) files created using Final Draft versions 5 through
13. While importing, paragraphs formatted in scene heading, action, character, parenthetical, shot
and transition are imported and identified as such. Scrite can also import from plain text and
fountain files, although there may be import errors.

Once imported, you can click on the Scene list panel button to the left, or use keyboard shortcut
`Alt+0`, to take a look at all the scenes.

<img src="../images/quickstart/009-scene-list-panel.png" alt="Scene List Panel" width="720"/>

Click on any scene listed in this panel to quickly navigate to that scene in the screenplay editor.

Notice how Scrite calculates page count, and also estimates screentime once you import your
screenplay. Additionally, it shows the time taken by each scene in the scene list panel. If you
hover any of the scenes in the scene list panel Scrite shows you additional meta-data about that
scene. Time estimates are calculated based on the assumption that each page of the screenplay
translates to one minute of screentime. It is possible to configure this.

## Creating a new screenplay
To start from scratch, launch the Home Screen and select the Blank Document option.

<img src="../images/quickstart/010-blank-document.png" alt="Blank Document" width="720"/>

When you launch Scrite, the first thing you will notice is that there is a blank scene, with the
initial scene heading shown as `EXT. SOMEWHERE – DAY`.

<img src="../images/quickstart/010-first-scene.png" alt="First Scene" width="720"/>

As mentioned before, Scrite’s UI is scene-centric. So you will not see pages in the app, but you
will see a text block for each scene.

To create a new scene, you can click on the `New Scene` button in the toolbar, or use the keyboard
shortcut Ctrl+Shift+N (on Windows & Linux) or ⌘+Shift+N (on macOS).

<img src="../images/quickstart/011-second-scene.png" alt="Adding a Scene" width="540"/>

This will create a new empty scene after the currently selected scene (or at the end, if no scene is
selected).

<img src="../images/quickstart/012-second-scene.png" alt="Second Scene" width="720"/>

You can also use the buttons at the end to append a new scene, act or episode break.

<img src="../images/quickstart/013-adding-elements.png" alt="Adding Elements" width="320"/>

Scrite will add a new scene with a default scene heading and cursor blinking in the scene content
area of that scene.

## Saving and Opening Files
New files are unnamed and unsaved. Scrite allows you to work on your screenplay until you actually
decide to save it.

While we do have auto-save, it kicks in only if enabled and after a file has been saved atleast once
and is in a directory which can be written into.

To save a file, you simply have to click on the save icon , select a folder and provide a file name.
Scrite files are saved with extension .scrite.

You can open files by

- Double clicking on the .scrite file in File Explorer (Windows), Finder (macOS) or
Nautilus/Konqueror (Linux). 
- If that doesn’t work, then go to the Home Screen and select the Open option (or simply use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O (on Windows & Linux), ⌘+O (on macOS). 
- Alternatively, you can drag and drop your Scrite document on the app-window to open it.

## Editing the Scene Heading
You can click on the Scene Heading or use keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Zero (⌘+Zero) to move cursor to the
scene heading and edit it.

< Screenshot >

When you are done, you can hit Enter to switch cursor to the scene content area.

Here is the first difference between Scrite and other apps. While other apps provide a way to mark
any paragraph as a scene heading, Scrite requires you to create a scene explicitly and assign a
scene heading to it. Later on in a future article, we will show you how (and why) you can create
scenes without a scene heading.

Also notice how the Scene heading area has a color to it and it also shows characters list. Infact,
you can configure Scrite to show you the scene synopsis as well.

< Screenshot >

Once you check the “Scene Synopsis” option, you will notice that a new area now shows up in the
scene heading where you can type the synopsis of your scene.

< Screenshot >

The Synopsis field is where you can type a short description of what you think should happen in this
scene. When you export your screenplay to PDF, the synopsis is not exported by default; although you
can toggle that option explicitly if you want.

## Typing Scene Content

While writing your scene content, you probably want to format your action, character, dialogue,
parenthetical, shot and transition paragraphs. Scrite has a button for each paragraph type on the
toolbar as shown below.

< Screenshot >

While editing you can also use keyboard shortcuts as outlined in the table below to switch between
various paragraph types.

| Paragraph Type | Windows, Linux | macOS | 
|:---------------|:---------------|:------|
| Action | Ctrl+1 | ⌘+1 | 
| Character | Ctrl+2 | ⌘+2 | 
| Dialogue | Ctrl+3 | ⌘+3 | 
| Parenthetical | Ctrl+4 | ⌘+4 | 
| Shot | Ctrl+5 | ⌘+5 | 
| Transition | Ctrl+6 | ⌘+6 | 

Infact, in most cases you can simply use the Tab key to switch to the paragraph type, of the current
paragraph under the cursor, to the next most appropriate paragraph type.

Shown below is contents of a scene, with paragraphs properly formatted.

## Adding More Scenes

As mentioned before, you can keep creating more scenes and adding content to each of the scenes. To
add a new scene, you can either click on the new scene button at the end of the page or on the
toolbar as shown below.

> **A note on scene lengths**
>
> Scrite is optimized for screenplays that follow best practices in structure—featuring
> predominantly short scenes with a few longer ones as needed.
>
>The app performs best when most scenes are under a page in length, with occasional scenes extending
>up to two pages. This not only supports smoother performance but also aligns with industry
>standards for pacing and reader engagement. While you can write longer scenes in Scrite, please
>note that if the majority of scenes exceed two pages, the app’s performance may become noticeably
>sluggish and, in some cases, difficult to use. For the best experience, we recommend keeping scene
>lengths concise as much as possible.

## Scene List Panel
As shown before, you can click on the icon along the left edge of the window to toggle visibility of
the scene list panel.

<screenshot>

Clicking on a scene heading in the left causes Scrite to switch to that scene on the editor. You can
even reorder scenes on the list by clicking on a scene and dragging it to another position in the
screenplay.

## Distraction Free Writing
You can turn off scene character list and synopsis panels using the “Screenplay Editor Options”
menu.

<screenshot>

And finally, you can collapse the scene list panel on the left. You will now have a clean and
distraction free writing area.

## Editing The Title Page
You can click on the “Edit Title Page” button at the top of your screenplay.

<Screenshot>

This opens a title page editor dialog box, where you can assign a cover page image and also key
values against title-page fields.

<screenshot>

Once done, you can click on the close icon on the top right of the dialog box to apply the changes.
From then on, the title page fields along with the cover art will show up before the first scene of
your screenplay.

## Exporting to PDF
You can select Export > Adobe PDF, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+P (on Windows & Linux), ⌘+P (on
macOS) to preview how your screenplay would look when exported to PDF.

The “Export to Adobe PDF” configuration dialog box offers a bunch of options to customise how your
PDF file will look. In here you can toggle title page, synopsis and more.

<screenshot>

Please review the options available on this dialog box and customize your PDF output the way you
like it.

Finally, click on “Generate PDF” to generate a preview of the PDF file.

<screenshot>

Once you are satisfied, you can click on the “Save PDF” button along the bottom edge of the dialog
box to save the PDF file to a location of your choice.

Please note that you will not be able to change or remove the default watermark while you are using
the app in free-trial. Please purchase a plan that supports customisation of watermarks to change or
remove the watermark.
