# User Account

When you [installed Scrite for the first time](./index.md#installing-scrite), you would have created
a Scrite account. All your subscriptions are tagged to this account and you can always stay on top
of that information in the User Account Dialog.

This dialog brings together profile information, subscription status, a catalog of activated
devices, and in-app messages. Visiting it allows you to update your profile, reiview subscription
and device activations.

## User Account Dialog

There are two ways to launch the user account dialog. 

- One is by clicking on the user account icon to the top right corner of the main-window,
- The other is by using the `F8` shortcut.

You can discover and configure shortcuts for each of the pages displayed here in the [shortcuts
dialog](./user-interface.md#keyboard-shortcuts).

## Profile Page

The Profile page displays the e‑mail address linked to your Scrite account and lets you edit your
personal details. 

Below the fields are two toggle switches:

- Usage analytics – enable or disable data collection.
- Marketing e‑mail – opt in or out of promotional messages.

After changing any field or toggle, click Save to apply the updates.

### Logout

on the current device. This allows you to recycle your subscription on a new device. Please read the

## Subscriptions Page

The **Subscriptions** page shows two kinds of information:

1. **Your subscription history** – the plans you’ve already purchased.  
2. **Available plans** – new plans you can buy when your current plan is ending or has ended.

Each subscription entry has a **Details** link. Clicking it opens a dialog that lists the plan’s
features, the start and end dates, and any billing details you may need.

To compare the feature sets of all plans, click the **Compare Plans** link. This opens a
side‑by‑side comparison table that highlights the differences between each tier.

### Buying a new plan
Next to every plan that’s available for purchase you’ll see a **Buy** link. Clicking it opens a web
page where you can complete the payment.  Once the transaction finishes, the **Subscriptions** page
refreshes automatically to show the new plan.  

### Active Feature Set
If you purchase a new plan while an existing subscription is still active, the new plan appears as
an **Upcoming** subscription.  You can immediately use all features of the new plan.

For example, buying a yearly plan while on the Free Trial lets you edit or remove watermarks from
PDFs for the remainder of the trial period.

### Referral Codes
Referral codes unlock special plans that aren’t normally available. Special plans thus unlocked may
offer you access to a new set of features and/or offer a significant discont on generally available
plans. You may get hold of referral codes from a friend, or a video on social media, or by
participating in partner events and workshops.

Click **Enter Referral Code** link, and type the code you received from a video or a friend.

After submitting, the page will refresh to show any new plans that have been unlocked.  

<img src="../images/user-account/006-referral-code.jpg" width=640"/>

These plans can be purchased exactly like the regular ones by clicking the **Buy** link next to
them.

> **NOTE:** Plans unlocked via a referral code may expire after a short period. Use them quickly
> before they become unavailable. 

> **NOTE** Screenshots above are for references purposes only.

## Installations Page

This page shows every device that has ever activated Scrite under your account. The current device
is highlighted in **bold**; other devices are listed below in order of most recent session time.

Each entry has a **Sign Out** button. Clicking it removes the device from the active list. The change
takes effect on the remote device after it reconnects or restarts, which may take up to an hour.

### Device Limits
Scrite enforces a maximum number of active devices per subscription tier. If you exceed the limit,
you’ll need to log out of an existing device before adding a new one. Use the **Logout** button
either on another device in this page, or in the [Profile](#logout) page to free a slot.

## Messages Page

All messages from the Scrite project appear here. A badge on the user‑account icon shows the number
of unread messages; clicking the icon jumps straight to this page. Critical messages also trigger a
notification in the main window.
